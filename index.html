  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Although we do not collect or transmit any data, we take reasonable measures to ensure that the app is secure, stable, and cannot be used to access your device or information in any unauthorized way.</p>

  <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
  <p>As no data is collected, there are no user data rights necessary. However, if you have concerns or questions about this policy, you are welcome to contact us.</p>
